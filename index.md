    <h2>Week 8 October 29th</h2>
    <p>All parts arrived over the reading week. RGB LED included a customs duty of $25 that I did not originally budget for a few weeks ago.  Made a PCB of the LED/Blue Pill connection
    Connection: Green to B7<br/>
                Blue to B8<br/>
                Common Cathode to Ground<br/>
                red to B9<br/>

   <h2>Week 7 October 15th</h2>
    <p>Both the LED and the STM32 have not arrived yet, the LED i'm assuming is being held at customs and I'm not sure what is holding up the blue pill. I'm hoping both devices arrive during the reading week so i can begin to build my circuit board for the assignment.  The delay in my materials is also delaying the PCB design of my board.  If the materials arrive duringthe break I should get started on the design right away.</p>
    <h2> Week 6 October 8th</h2>
    <p>Ordered the STM32F103C8t6 from amazon for $19.85 with free shipping the device is not being shipped from Amazon's warehouse but rather from Universal Solder. The shipping fee was about $3.50 cad, which currently brings the total spent on the project so far to about $43. I'm currently about $7 under the allocated budget.  The LED has not arrive yet the tracking currently says it's in transition. I'm assuming it's being held up at customs.

    <h2>Week 5 October 1st</h2>
    <p>Purchased the LED from Microcontrollershop.com. Store is based in US and part should arrive in the next 5 business days. The shipping cost for the LED is about $12.00 USD bringing the total cost of the the device at $13.98USD or $20CAD.  The device is being shipped first class, so it should arrive some time next week I will update the blog when it arrives.

    <h2>Week 3 September 23</h2>
    <p>Prepared budget for our project after selecting the sensors and effectors each group member will acquire. I will be using the YSL-R596CR3G4B5C-C10 which is an RGB LED. To program the device I will be using an  STM32F103C8T6 microcomputer.  I found the LED at an online retailer for $2.50USD, and the microcontroller is available on Amazon for $19.85. The budget for the sensor and device is planned at $50, to make up for the currency conversion and shipping cost of the LED. The Microcontroller will be shipped for free because I have Amazon prime.</p>
 Testing
    <h2>Week 2 September 17</h2>
    <p>Spoke with team members Boswell and Bobby, and decided on how we will split up the duties. Also prepared a Gantt chart of the production process in order to avoid a watershed process.</p>
   
  <h2>Week1 September 10</h2>
    <p>Selected project thats sponspred by Makerkids.  Our goal is to make a mini smarthome using sensors that the kids of the Makerkids program are familiar with.</p>
